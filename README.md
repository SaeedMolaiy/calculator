One day, our IT department rolled out a Windows image so "optimized"… it forgot the Calculator. Yes. No calculator. None.

We could’ve just installed one. But where’s the fun in that?
So I built one, using WPF!

This project also served as my gateway into the world of WPF. I always wanted to learn it, but never had the motivation until now!

This is my first-ever WPF project, and I had a blast building it.
